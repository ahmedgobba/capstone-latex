To summarize our main results, we have found that average SF ratio over the first 24 hours of ICU stay (SF ratio) is significantly correlated with patient outcome, with the risk of  mortality significantly increasing at values of SF ratio below 180. Furthermore, the risk is exacerbated for patients on invasive mechanical ventilation than in those on non-invasive mechanical ventilation. 

We believe that this provides compelling reason to conduct further studies that examine our covariate of choice - average SF ratio over the first 24 hours of ICU stay - as a direct predictor of patient outcome. We hope that we have contributed to the field through our study.
